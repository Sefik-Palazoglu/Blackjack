# Blackjack
Blackjack is a little game that runs on command line. You can play blackjack with your computer who plays as a dealer against you.

I came across the idea when I was studying C++ [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/). The folks out there created this as a quiz which you are supposed to implement after completing their arrays chapter. They assign you the same task but expect you to do it in OOP after the basic OOP chapter. You can find the questions here:
- [initial quiz](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/chapter-9-comprehensive-quiz/)
- [OOP version](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/chapter-11-comprehensive-quiz/)

I shamelessly copy-pasted some of their code, but I am improving, refactoring, commenting it and adding additional features in here.

# How To Play
If you are on Linux and have g++, make, and ar utilities installed on your system, it is very easy to start playing!
1. Clone the repo on your machine by typing `git clone <link>` in your CLI.
2. Navigate in the repo and type `make` in your CLI.
3. If you didn't receive any errors (hopefully) type `./blackjack.exe` and start playing!
